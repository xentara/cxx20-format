This library contains an implementation of the C++20 std::format facility with
its related functionality. It is meant meant as a substitute for the C++20
header <format> for libstdc++ from gcc-12, where it is missing. The
implementation is simply backported from gcc-13.

The implementation does not include formatters for std::chrono, as those
are dependent on the calendar facility, which is also missing.
